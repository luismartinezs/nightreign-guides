The great hollow map has crystals that users must crack. These crystals can appear in the map in 4 different distributions, where the crystals are distributed in a different way.

The player does not know a priori which of these distributions the map loaded, so they must crack cyrstals and by elimination determine the distribution

They way the user uses this widget is as follows:

- the user opens the map (/great-hollow-map) and sees a handful of crystals on it, for all the possible locations, each button being a crystal.
- the user clicks on a crystal, and the system updates the view to show the possible locations of the other crystals based on the crystal the user clicked
- when the user clicks another crystal, the map is updated once again to narrow down further crystal locations
